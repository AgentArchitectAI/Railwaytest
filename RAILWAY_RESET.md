# 🚨 RAILWAY SERVICE RESET - Fix "Invalid Input" Error

**File: /RAILWAY_RESET.md**

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
The `railway.json` file was causing the "build.builder: Invalid input" error. **DELETED!**

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **🗑️ Removed `railway.json`** - this was causing the build failure
2. **🐍 Added `runtime.txt`** - tells Railway to use Python 3.12
3. **🐳 Cleaned Dockerfile** - optimized for Railway deployment

## 🔧 **DEPLOY NOW - 3 OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Push and Retry (Fastest)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove railway.json - fix build.builder invalid input"
git push origin main
```
Then **manually trigger a redeploy** in Railway dashboard.

### **Option 2: Recreate Service (Most Reliable)**
1. **Delete current service** in Railway dashboard
2. **Create new service** from same GitHub repo  
3. Railway will auto-detect Python + Docker correctly

### **Option 3: Switch to Nixpacks**
In Railway service settings:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment**
2. Change **Builder** from "Docker" to "Nixpacks" 
3. Remove the Dockerfile temporarily

## 🎯 **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**

- **railway.json** with `"builder": "docker"` was conflicting with Railway's auto-detection
- Railway couldn't parse the Docker configuration properly  
- **Auto-detection works better** than manual configuration for simple projects

## 📋 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

✅ Railway will now auto-detect Python project  
✅ Use the `runtime.txt` for Python 3.12  
✅ Build with minimal Flask + ezdxf dependencies  
✅ Deploy successfully without "Invalid input" errors

## 🚀 **TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

Once deployed, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "simple house with 2 doors and 3 windows"}'
```

**This should now work!** 🎉
